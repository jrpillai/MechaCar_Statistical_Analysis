## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Based on the linear regression analysis, vehicle_length and ground_clearance both provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset at the 0.05% significance level. In other words, vehicle_length and ground_clearance are likely to have a significant impact on mpg. 

With a p-value of 5.35e-11, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero. 

The r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that roughly 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (mpg) is explained using this linear regression model. This means our model is moderately effective in predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
