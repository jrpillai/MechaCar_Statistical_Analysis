## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Based on the linear regression analysis, vehicle_length and ground_clearance both provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset at the 0.05% significance level. In other words, vehicle_length and ground_clearance are likely to have a significant impact on mpg. 

With a p-value of 5.35e-11, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero. 

The r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that roughly 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (mpg) is explained using this linear regression model. This means our model is moderately effective in predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Our total summary shows that as a whole, variance of the suspension coil PSI is about 62 lbs per square inch, which meets the design specifications of no more than 100 lbs per square inch.

However, our lot summary shows that the variance of one lot greatly exceeds the design specifications. Lot 3 has a variance of about 170 lbs per square inch, almost twice the maximum. Lot 1 and 2 fall well within specifications with about 1 lb per square inch and 7 lbs per square inch of variance respectively.
